IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Only identify what you can ACTUALLY SEE in the frames
2. Don't fabricate jersey numbers or player names you can't read
3. State your confidence level for each observation
4. If you see a simplified version of a scheme, identify it appropriately
5. Consider the apparent skill level when making identifications

## 🎽 CRITICAL: TEAM IDENTIFICATION

**You MUST distinguish between the two teams by their uniform/jersey colors.**

Note: Basketball courts are typically light-colored hardwood with white boundary lines. Do NOT confuse court markings or the court surface with jersey colors. Focus on the PLAYERS' UNIFORMS to identify teams.

| **${teamInfo.yourTeam.name || 'Your Team'}** | **${yourTeamColor || 'UNKNOWN'}** uniforms/jerseys | Context only - note how they are affected by the opponent |

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Focus ALL analysis (offense AND defense) on the players wearing **${opponentColor}**-colored uniforms
- Identify ${opponentColor}-uniformed players by their jersey numbers and positions on the court
- Use the ${yourTeamColor || 'other'}-uniformed team only as context to understand what the ${opponentColor} team is doing
- If ${opponentColor} uniforms are hard to distinguish from the court or background, look for jersey numbers, shorts color, and shoe colors to track those players

No specific jersey colors were provided. Identify the two teams by their uniform colors, then provide comprehensive analysis of the team that appears to be the visiting/opponent team.
